      <h1 class='text1'>Pig Dice Game Rules 🐷</h1> <br>
      <p class='ptext'>Pig is a simple dice game which you win by being the first player to score 100 or more points.</p> <br><br>
      <h2 class='text2'>So how do you play Pig?</h2> <br>
      <p class='ptext'>The starting player rolls the die and scores as many points as the total shown on the die providing the die doesn’t roll a 1. The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end his turn.
        If the player rolls a 1 their turn is over, they lose all points they've accumulated that turn, and then it's the next players turn.
        Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined. The first player to reach 100 WINS!</p>
